# Spam Email Classifier using Machine Learning

This project implements a spam email/SMS classifier using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

## Dataset
- SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- Labeled as spam and non-spam (ham)

## Approach
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Naive Bayes

## Results
- High accuracy with strong precision for spam detection
- No legitimate messages incorrectly marked as spam

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
2. Open `spam_classifier.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
