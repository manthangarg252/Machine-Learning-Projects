# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using numerical and categorical features.

## Objective
To build and evaluate a supervised machine learning model that predicts house prices based on housing-related features.

## Dataset
- Public housing dataset
- Includes information such as location, population, income, and housing characteristics

## Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## Additional Features
- Feature scaling for improved model performance
- Feature importance visualization using model coefficients
- Actual vs Predicted price visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Outcome
- Accurate prediction of house prices
- Clear understanding of feature influence on predictions
- Strong foundation in regression-based machine learning models
