# Data Cleaning and Visualization using Python

This project focuses on cleaning raw data and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights using Python.

## Objective
To preprocess a real-world dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, data types, and outliers, followed by visual analysis to identify trends and patterns.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (Open-source)
- Contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and survival status

## Key Steps Performed
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicate records
- Encoding categorical variables
- Outlier detection and removal
- Data type correction
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Visualizations
- Histogram for age distribution
- Bar chart for survival analysis
- Box plot for age vs passenger class
- Violin plot for survival distribution
- Correlation heatmap

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Outcome
- Cleaned and structured dataset
- Visual insights into survival patterns
- Strong foundation in data preprocessing and analysis

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
